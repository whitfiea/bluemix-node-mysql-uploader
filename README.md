# Overview of the App #

This is a Node.js app that uses the following cloud services:

-   MySQL Database

This app demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL database on IBM BlueMix from a Node.js app. 
Simply upload a line-separated file of text (e.g. tweets), and it will add each line to MySQL.

Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

### [Alternative] Deploying the App Via the Command-Line ###

#### Prerequisites ####

Before we begin, we first need to install the [**cf**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) command line tool that will be used to upload and manage your application. If you've previously installed an older version of the cf tool, make sure you are now using v6 of cf by passing it the -v flag:

    cf -v

#### Steps ####
In the terminal, go into the root directory, and follow these steps.

1. Login to Bluemix.

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf login [-a API_URL] [-o ORG] [-s SPACE]`|
   |------------|----------------------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net`   |

2. Create an instance of the mySQL service, giving it the name "mysql-database" in the last arguement. Note, if a different name is desired, then the manifest.yml file needs to be changed accordingly.

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE`|
   |------------|----------------------------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf create-service mysql 100 mysql-database`     |

3. From the root directory that contains this *README.md* file, push the app like below.  Be sure to give your app a unique APP_NAME to be used for its hostname. For instance the example below would result in http://myupload-&lt;username&gt;.ng.bluemix.net.

   | *usage:*   | `$ cf push APP_NAME`                  |
   |------------|----------------------------------|
   | *example:* | `$ cf push myupload-<username>`  |

Congratulations, the app should be running on Bluemix.
